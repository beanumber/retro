[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beanumber/retro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beanumber/retro)

An R package for creating a Retrosheet database using the ETL framework

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("beanumber/retro")
library(retro)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
system("mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS retrosheet;'")
db <- src_mysql_cnf("retrosheet")
retro <- etl("retro", db = db, dir = "~/Data/retro/")

retro %>%
  etl_init() %>%
  etl_extract(season = 2013:2016) %>%
  etl_transform(season = 2014:2016) %>%
  etl_load(season = 2014)

# add partitions
dbRunScript(retro$con, 
            system.file("sql", "optimize.mysql", package = "retro"))
```

## Compare To

- (https://github.com/rmscriven/retrosheet): last commit was 2015; not on CRAN; does not require `chadwick`
- (https://github.com/davidbmitchell/Baseball-PostgreSQL): Only for PostgreSQL; also requires `chadwick`


## Installing Chadwick

On Ubuntu:

```{bash, eval=FALSE} 
# download the source code
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/chadwick/files/chadwick-0.7/chadwick-0.7.2/chadwick-0.7.2.tar.gz -P /tmp
# unzip it
tar xvzf chadwick-0.7.2.tar.gz
# change directory
cd chadwick-0.7.2
# setup the source code for compilation
./configure
# build it from scratch
make
# install it
sudo make install
# set the linker path so it will actually work
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

```
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
```
